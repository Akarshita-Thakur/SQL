# SQL
The SQL Book Store Management System is a database-driven project designed to manage and streamline the operations of a book store. It involves the creation of a relational database using SQL to handle key functionalities such as inventory management, customer information, order processing, and sales tracking. The system includes multiple interrelated tables such as Books, Authors, Customers, Orders, and Order_Details, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. SQL queries, joins, and procedures are used to perform CRUD operations, generate sales reports, track stock levels, and analyze customer purchasing behavior. This project demonstrates core database management concepts including normalization, indexing, and data integrity.
